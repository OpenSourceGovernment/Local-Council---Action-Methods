# Local Council - Freedom of Information Request
Use this method to gather information on a Subject or to force action on a Public Body issue. 

## How does it work
A single FOI request may be costly for a Public Body as one or more employees will be required to gather the information from various sources. A single request may bring a Subject to light within the Public Body as the communications and decisions of individuals and groups will be published in a public forum. With multiple OSG Members requesting similar FOI requests the overall cost to the Public Body could become so high that they will have no option but to re-assess the targetted Subject.

## Example
A vehicle hits a pothole in Chapel Road and the resulting damage costs Â£400 to fix. The driver posts evidence of the damage and resulting cost to the Open Source Government. OSG members affected by the pothole or with an interest in seeing the issue resolved create an OSG public forum and each send a Freedom of Information Request to the Public Body asking for details of the Public Body's obligations to keep roads in a state of good repair each member also requests any communications specific to this pothole and the contractor employed to fix it.

The Public Body is obliged at each request to gather the information and send it to the requesting party. As each new request will add to the data stored the Public Body will be unable to send the exact same information to each party. The cost of each request will mount and the information supplied will identify the key individuals within the Public Body responsible for delaying the repair of the road. The information when published will allow the public to assign responsibility to individuals instead of the Public Body as a whole. 

The OSG forum may then approach the Public Body with information regarding the Individuals responsible and request appropriate action be taken to resolve the issue.

## What's the Point
The point of this Action is to create a situation whereby the Public Body is in a better position to fix the issue than to persist with diverting resources to the Freedom of Information Requests.

A secondary result is the identification of key personnel within the public body that are neglectful, inefficient and / or corrupt.
